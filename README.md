This extension monitors file selection events on configured websites. When a file is selected for upload, it checks if the file's extension matches your predefined list (or if the "Rename All" option is active). If a match occurs, it creates a modified version of the file object locally with a .txt extension before the browser processes the upload, effectively bypassing website restrictions without altering your original file.
