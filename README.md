Websites Acting Picky About File Types? Fight Back with the Auto TXT Renamer! âœŠ

You crafted the perfect code (.js, .ts), tweaked that config (.yaml, .cfg), or saved essential logs (.log), but NOOOO! The website throws a digital tantrum: "ONLY .TXT FILES ALLOWED!" ðŸ˜©

Don't let stubborn upload forms dictate your file life! Auto TXT Renamer is your sneaky sidekick. It intercepts those files right before they leave your browser and whispers sweet .txt nothings into their names. âœ¨ Poof! âœ¨ The website is none the wiser, and your upload sails through.

How the Magic Happens:

You Make the Hit List: Head to Options and tell the Renamer which pesky extensions need a .txt disguise (no dots needed!).

Grant Site Access: Visit the picky website, click the Renamer's icon, and hit "Enable on This Site". You're the boss â€“ it only works where you say so!

Upload Like Normal: Select your .ts, .log, or other text-based file.

Instant Makeover: The Renamer swaps the extension to .txt in a flash, locally in your browser. Your original file is untouched!

Awesome Perks:

âœ… You Control the List: Rename only the extensions that annoy you.

ðŸ”’ Site-Specific Action: Enable the magic only on the websites you choose via the popup.

ðŸš€ "Rename EVERYTHING" Mode: Feeling bold? A toggle lets you slap a .txt ending on any file you upload (use with gusto, or caution!).

ðŸ‘€ Manage Permissions: Easily see and revoke access for sites in the Options page.
